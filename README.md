**Disclaimer**

This is an **experimental** peripheral for interaction between [AppliedEnergistics2](http://ae2.ae-mod.info/) and [ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/). It is very much in alpha state. There are also no crafting recipes yet, i.e. creative mode only. It is also not tested thoroughly with larger networks or on a server.

At this point this is purely a "for fun and education" project.

**About**

The mod basically adds a computer controlled ME Interface and allows two things:
 - Export/Import items from/to the ME System, including specific NBT tagged items and items that need to be crafted first.
 - Provide Crafting Patterns to the ME System.
